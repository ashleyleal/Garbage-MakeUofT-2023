# Inspiration: 
Welcome to the world of useless inventions, where creativity and absurdity collide! In this strange and comical realm, we introduce to you the "Garbage". This useless invention is a trashcan like no other. As you try to throw something in, the trashcan closes and begins to laugh hysterically at you, mocking your futile attempt to dispose of your waste. But that's not all - Garbage takes things to the next level by running away from you after every failed attempt, making it nearly impossible to get rid of your trash. While this invention may not serve any practical purpose, it's sure to bring a few laughs and a lot of frustration to those who dare to try and use it. So, come on in, and join us in exploring the absurd world of useless inventions with Garbage!

# What it does: 
Garbage is a useless invention that closes its lid and laughs when you try to throw something in. It then runs away, making it difficult to dispose of your trash. This comical approach to taking out the trash adds a playful and humorous element to an otherwise tedious task.

# How we built it: 
The Garbage is a quirky invention that has been built using an Arduino Due microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors, buzzer, servo motors, and a standard trash can. The code has been programmed in Arduino's integrated development environment (IDE), which allows the ultrasonic sensors to detect the motion of an object and trigger the servo motors to close the lid of the trashcan. Once the lid is closed, a buzzer plays, making it humiliating to dispose of the trash. This absurd and playful approach to taking out the trash adds an element of creativity and fun to an otherwise mundane task.

# Challenges we ran into: 
As we work on coding and building things, we encountered obstacles and difficulties that arise from the limitations of both the programming language and hardware architecture we were working with. In addition, we encountered issues with determining the appropriate rotation angle for the mechanism, as well as finding ways to integrate all of the necessary functions and components into the garbage can within our limited timeframe.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of: 
We take great pride in our successful creation of the sensors, buzzer, mechanism, and servo motors, as well as the project as a whole. The experience was incredibly rewarding and we feel a sense of accomplishment in having designed and built a functional system using Arduino. It was extremely satisfying to see all of our hard work pay off in the end, as the system we built successfully performed most of its intended functions.

# What we learned: 
Throughout the process, we gained a wealth of knowledge and experience in both coding and hardware as it pertains to working with Arduino ide. We were able to learn and develop new skills that will undoubtedly prove invaluable in our future endeavors. As first-year engineering students, the process of designing and constructing machines was both challenging and incredibly fun. It was exciting to see our designs come to life as we worked to create functional machines with a range of capabilities. From designing the circuitry to coding the software, every step of the process provided an opportunity to learn new skills and explore different approaches.

# What's next for Garbage: 
As we move forward, we plan to expand the capabilities of our Arduino-based garbage disposal system. Our goal is to introduce additional features and functions that will further enhance the user experience. To accomplish this, we will continue to refine the design and add new components to the system. For example, we aim to incorporate sensors that enable the garbage can to move in the x and y directions, which will improve the accuracy of waste disposal. Additionally, we plan to add music and aesthetic design elements to make the system more engaging and visually appealing. By constantly iterating and improving our design, we hope to create a system that is not only functional, but also fun and enjoyable to use.
